## Description

_This app dives into the *company* endpoint of the ChowNow API and uses a simple list/detail UI to demonstrate the fetching of restaurant data.
It includes a separate module **chow-now-api** that leverages Retrofit to communicate with the API and extract the desired information._

_The **chow-now-api** only focuses on desired fields: location name, formatted address, latitude, longitude._

2. Run the tests in module **app** if needed
